Host: Coach, headline takeaway from the 2024 season?
Coach: Shot conversion. We finished at roughly forty-six point eight percent, while opponents were around thirty-eight point six. We created and finished good looks.

Host: If you’re chasing two more wins next year, what’s the lever—offense or defense?
Coach: Defense. Our attack produced, but tightening opponent efficiency—limiting clean looks, better closeouts—can flip close results our way.

Host: Name one player who defined offensive impact.
Coach: Emma Tyrrell. She led with ninety-two points—seventy goals and twenty-two assists—and was constantly involved, taking one hundred thirty-five shots and helping on draws.

Host: Possession was a theme—who owned the circle?
Coach: Katelyn Mashewske. Two hundred thirty-four draw controls. That volume of extra possessions sets the tone for tempo and pressure.

Host: Give me one team metric that clearly tilted in your favor.
Coach: Draw controls overall—three hundred eighty-four to three hundred thirty-four. More first touches means more chances to control pace and get our sets.

Host: If the focus is defense, who’s your ‘game changer’ profile?
Coach: Natalie Smith. Thirty-six ground balls and thirty-six draws, plus she contributes on offense. With some role tuning—matchups and on-ball disruption—she can swing key possessions.

Host: Final word on priorities for the off‑season?
Coach: Keep our shooting quality, train late-clock defense and interior help, and convert our possession edge into scoreboard separation.

Host: Appreciate it, coach—see you next season.
